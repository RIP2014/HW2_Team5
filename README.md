## Problem 1
To run the Simulations

`python problem1/domain[x].py [y]`
where x and y are 1 or 2 for domain and bug 1 or 2


## Problem 2

To run simulations bring up the PField.java file, located in
 ../Problem2/PotentialFields/src/PField.java, compile the file, then hit run. 

To change the obstacles go to PfieldPanel.java located in the same spot as PField.java. Go to line 59 where the two sets of obstacles are and comment out the ones you donâ€™t want to appear. You can also create new Obstacles for the problem as well if you so choose.
