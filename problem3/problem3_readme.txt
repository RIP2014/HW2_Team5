Information on running the files.


PROBLEM 3A:
Compile armvis.java. Run armvis.java. Running the file should run the simulation with no additional requirements.
Should you desire to see the simulation at a slower speed, you can change the wait time between each step. Change line 114 to the desired amount of milliseconds you wish to wait.


PROBLEM 3B:
Compile armviswithobstacles.java. Run armviswithobstacles.java. Running the file should run the simulation with no additional requirements.
Should you desire to see the simulation at a slower speed, you can change the wait time between each step. Change line 151 to the desired amount of milliseconds you wish to wait.
